 Chicago
 
 The ListView sample application implements a simple list
 view control in Chicago, which is the code name for the
 next version of the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) operating
 system. The list view control allows an application to
 display information in four different ways, called views:
 standard icon, small icon, list view, and report view. The
 sample implements a list view control for viewing real
 estate information. Each (fictional) house listed has an
 associated bitmap and columns for address, city, price,
 number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Clicking a
 column heading sorts the list by that heading. For
 example, clicking the Price column heading sorts the list
 by price.
 
 ListView is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 4: Header Windows and List View Windows"
 technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 ListView was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The ListView executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
